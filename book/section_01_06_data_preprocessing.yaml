  overview: |
    Real-world data is messy. Security logs have missing timestamps. User inputs 
    contain garbage characters. API response times have outliers from network hiccups. 
    Feature values span wildly different ranges: email length (10-1000 characters) 
    vs exclamation count (0-5). If you feed this raw mess directly to ML models, 
    they will learn poorly or not at all.
    
    Data preprocessing transforms messy real-world data into clean, normalized 
    format that ML algorithms can actually learn from. This includes: handling 
    missing values, removing outliers, encoding categorical variables, and scaling 
    numerical features to comparable ranges.
    
    For security, preprocessing is critical because:
    1. Adversaries inject malformed data to break your pipeline (data poisoning)
    2. Poor preprocessing creates blind spots adversaries exploit
    3. Feature scaling affects which patterns models learn
    4. Train-test contamination leads to overoptimistic evaluation (false security)
    
    This section teaches you to clean data properly, normalize features correctly, 
    and avoid preprocessing pitfalls that create security vulnerabilities.
  
  why_this_matters: |
    Without proper preprocessing:
    - Models fail to converge (gradient descent doesn't work)
    - Large-scale features dominate (email length >> exclamation count)
    - Missing values cause crashes or silent failures
    - Outliers skew statistics and poison models
    - Test set contamination gives false confidence
    
    With proper preprocessing:
    - Models train faster and more reliably
    - All features contribute equally to learning
    - Pipeline is robust to messy real-world data
    - Evaluation accurately reflects production performance
    - Adversarial manipulation is easier to detect

  key_takeaways:
    
    conceptual_understanding:
      - "Preprocessing transforms messy real-world data into clean format for ML"
      - "Missing values can be imputed (filled) or indicated with separate features"
      - "Outliers can be errors, legitimate extremes, or attacks - investigate before removing"
      - "Feature scaling puts all features on comparable scales (critical for gradient descent)"
      - "ALWAYS fit preprocessing on training data, apply to test data"
    
    practical_skills:
      - "Implement mean/median imputation with NumPy"
      - "Detect outliers using z-score and IQR methods"
      - "Apply normalization (min-max) and standardization (z-score) scaling"
      - "Build complete preprocessing pipeline that fits on train, transforms train and test"
      - "Handle missing values, outliers, and scaling in sequence"
    
    security_mindset:
      - "Outliers may be attacks - don't blindly remove them"
      - "Adversaries poison training data by manipulating preprocessing statistics"
      - "Use robust statistics (median, IQR) in adversarial environments"
      - "Missing values can be evasion technique - track missingness patterns"
      - "Train-test leakage creates false security - model will fail in production"
    
    remember_this:
      - "Preprocessing is attack surface. Adversary manipulates it to poison or evade."
      - "Fit on train, transform test. NEVER let test data influence preprocessing."
      - "In security: Use robust statistics. Mean and std are vulnerable to poisoning."
