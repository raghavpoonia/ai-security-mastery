  # --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Overview and Context
  # --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  overview: |
    Activation functions are the non-linearity that makes neural networks powerful.
    Without them, a 100-layer network would be mathematically equivalent to a
    single linear layer - completely useless.
    
    This section covers every major activation function: sigmoid (smooth but
    vanishing gradients), tanh (zero-centered sigmoid), ReLU (fast but dead
    neurons), Leaky ReLU (fixes dead neurons), and modern alternatives (Swish,
    GELU, Mish).
    
    You'll implement all activation functions and their derivatives, benchmark
    performance, and understand the security implications - activation patterns
    leak model internals, gradient saturation affects robustness, and dead
    neurons create evasion opportunities.
    
    By the end, you'll know exactly which activation to use for any architecture.
  
  learning_objectives:
    
    conceptual:
      - "Understand why activation functions are critical (non-linearity)"
      - "Know the gradient vanishing problem and its causes"
      - "Grasp the dead neuron problem in ReLU"
      - "Understand zero-centering and why it matters"
      - "Connect activation choices to training dynamics"
      - "Recognize security implications of activation patterns"
    
    practical:
      - "Implement all major activation functions and derivatives"
      - "Visualize activation curves and gradient behaviors"
      - "Benchmark computational performance differences"
      - "Build activation function library for reuse"
      - "Choose appropriate activation for given architecture"
    
    security_focused:
      - "Activation patterns reveal model structure to attackers"
      - "Gradient saturation zones affect adversarial robustness"
      - "Dead neurons can be exploited for evasion attacks"
      - "Activation-based fingerprinting of model architecture"
  
  prerequisites:
    - "Section 0201 completed (perceptron, multi-layer networks)"
    - "Basic calculus (derivatives, chain rule)"
    - "Understanding of gradient descent"
