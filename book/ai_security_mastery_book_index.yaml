book_overview:
  
  what_this_book_covers: |
    This book takes you from zero ML knowledge to building production-grade 
    AI security detection systems in 90 days. Unlike typical ML courses that 
    focus on model accuracy, this is security-first: we teach you how models 
    work so you understand how they break, where they're vulnerable, and how 
    to defend them.
    
    We start by implementing machine learning algorithms from scratch using 
    only NumPy - no TensorFlow, no PyTorch, no magic. You'll build classifiers, 
    neural networks, and understand backpropagation by coding it yourself. 
    Then we move to modern LLMs: transformers, attention mechanisms, and the 
    architectures behind GPT and Claude.
    
    With that foundation, we dive into AI security: prompt injection, jailbreaks, 
    data poisoning, model extraction, and adversarial attacks. You'll learn the 
    OWASP LLM Top 10, implement each attack, and understand why they work at 
    the algorithmic level.
    
    Finally, we build detection systems: ML-based classifiers, behavioral 
    analysis, production API gateways, SIEM integration, and monitoring at scale. 
    You'll deploy real detectors, tune them to 95%+ accuracy, and analyze 
    thousands of API calls.
    
    This isn't theory. Every chapter has hands-on exercises. You'll build a 
    spam classifier from scratch, implement a transformer, catalog 50+ jailbreak 
    techniques, and ship a complete detection framework. By day 90, you'll have 
    a GitHub portfolio that proves you can build AI security systems, not just 
    talk about them.
  
  why_this_book_exists: |
    There's a massive gap in the market. Security engineers need to understand 
    AI security, but most ML courses are built for data scientists. They teach 
    you to maximize accuracy, not understand vulnerabilities. They use high-level 
    libraries that abstract away the mechanisms adversaries exploit.
    
    Meanwhile, AI security courses assume you already know ML. They jump straight 
    to attacks without teaching you why gradient descent matters or how 
    backpropagation flows. You can't secure what you don't understand.
    
    This book bridges that gap. It's written by a security engineer (13 years 
    SOC/detection engineering) who had to learn ML from scratch to enter AI 
    security. Every concept is explained from a security perspective: "Here's 
    how this works, here's where it breaks, here's how to exploit it, here's 
    how to detect it."
    
    The job market is screaming for AI security talent. Every FAANG company is 
    hiring. But most candidates either know ML (and not security) or know 
    security (and not ML). This book creates the rare engineer who deeply 
    understands both.
  
  what_makes_this_different:
    
    no_black_boxes:
      description: "Implement everything from scratch before using libraries"
      rationale: "You can't secure APIs you don't understand. Build classifiers in NumPy, then use PyTorch."
      example: "Chapter 1 builds logistic regression from scratch. Only after understanding gradient descent do we use scikit-learn."
    
    security_first:
      description: "Every ML concept connected to security implications"
      rationale: "ML courses teach accuracy. We teach: 'Here's how this breaks.'"
      example: "Overfitting isn't just bad accuracy - it's a data extraction vector. We show how adversaries exploit it."
    
    production_focused:
      description: "Real systems, not toy examples"
      rationale: "Detection systems must handle millions of events. We build for scale."
      example: "API gateway with <50ms latency, SIEM integration, monitoring dashboards, A/B testing detectors."
    
    explicitly_scoped:
      description: "Clear about what's covered and what's not"
      rationale: "No false promises. We focus on LLM security (95% of jobs)."
      gaps_acknowledged:
        - "Computer vision security (adversarial patches)"
        - "Reinforcement learning security"
        - "Federated learning attacks"
        - "GAN/deepfake security"
      why_these_gaps: "90 days = focus on highest ROI. Can add advanced topics later."
    
    career_oriented:
      description: "Built to get you hired at FAANG/top security companies"
      rationale: "Every chapter contributes to your GitHub portfolio and resume."
      deliverables:
        - "Complete detection framework (resume line)"
        - "Blog posts proving expertise"
        - "Conference talk material"
        - "Open source contributions"
  
  learning_philosophy:
    
    build_then_use:
      principle: "Implement from scratch, then use libraries"
      example: "Build neural network with NumPy → Understand backprop → Use PyTorch confidently"
    
    understand_dont_memorize:
      principle: "Intuition over equations"
      example: "Gradient descent = 'walk downhill to find lowest point' before showing ∇f(x)"
    
    security_mindset:
      principle: "Always ask: 'How does this break? Where's the attack surface?'"
      example: "Training pipeline = potential poisoning. Inference = adversarial inputs. Outputs = data leakage."
    
    iterative_depth:
      principle: "Simple first, then complex"
      example: "Linear classifier → Neural network → Transformer. Each builds on previous."
    
    practical_first:
      principle: "Code before theory"
      example: "Implement logistic regression, see it work, then derive the math."
