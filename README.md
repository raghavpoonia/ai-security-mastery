## 🎯 What This Is

A comprehensive, hands-on learning path for security professionals entering AI security. Built by a security engineer with 13 years experience, targeting the critical gap between traditional security and AI/ML security.

**Not another ML course.** This is security-first, implementation-focused, and brutally practical.

## 🎓 Philosophy

**Build understanding from first principles:**
- Implement algorithms from scratch (NumPy) before using libraries
- Understand mathematics and theory deeply
- Know what's abstracted away by high-level APIs

**Security-focused throughout:**
- Every chapter connects to security implications
- Attack vectors taught alongside defenses
- Production deployment with security in mind

**Explicitly acknowledge gaps:**
- Clear scope: LLM security focus (95% of job market)
- Out of scope: CV security, RL security, federated learning
- Can add advanced topics later
